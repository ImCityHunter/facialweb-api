This course is taught by https://www.udemy.com/user/andrei-neagoie/ </br>

The project uses: postgres, knex, Clarifi-API, Javascript, CSS, HTML, express,...etc


I decided to take this course, because I had no knowledge in web development. This course is over 32 hours, but it took me more than a month to complete because I was also taking classes in school. It was a long process, but it was definitely worth it.


### Things to improve
1. Deploy this somewhere else other than heroku. Heroku is free and amazing, but this project is large, thus, running this on Heroku makes the website runs really slow </br>

2. Maybe to add some features,.. such as ranking and email verfication.
